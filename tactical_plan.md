# Tactical Plan Index — Boarding School Simulation Upgrade

This index links each milestone to a dedicated tactical plan detailing the exact steps, owners, and validation required to complete the milestone. Follow the milestones sequentially; each plan assumes completion of the previous ones.

| Milestone | Tactical Plan |
|-----------|---------------|
| A — Campus Layout & Navigation | [Milestone A Tactical Plan](tactical_plans/milestone_a_campus_layout.md) |
| B — Comprehensive Scheduling | [Milestone B Tactical Plan](tactical_plans/milestone_b_scheduling.md) |
| C — Activity Tracking & Reporting | [Milestone C Tactical Plan](tactical_plans/milestone_c_activity_tracking.md) |
| D — Player Management Hooks | [Milestone D Tactical Plan](tactical_plans/milestone_d_player_management.md) |
| E — QA & Polish | [Milestone E Tactical Plan](tactical_plans/milestone_e_qa_polish.md) |

Each tactical plan includes:
- **Preconditions** to verify before starting work.
- **Implementation Steps** with detailed technical guidance and ownership cues.
- **Deliverables** describing artifacts to produce.
- **Acceptance Criteria** that must be satisfied before declaring the milestone complete.

Always update progress notes and documentation as you execute a plan so downstream milestones inherit accurate context.
