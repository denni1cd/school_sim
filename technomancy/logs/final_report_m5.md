- Overlay confirmed active by **08:02** via event entry.

## Changes Landed
- Added policy history logging in `school_sim/world.py` and surfaced the last three decisions in `school_sim/office.py`, giving reports a record of policy switches alongside economy history.
- Introduced `school_sim/tests/test_policy_history.py` to validate the capped history plus the updated `test_office_reports.py` to look for the new report lines.
- Office policy infrastructure (uniform/discipline toggles + overlays) remains wired through the renderer, bootstrap loaders, and headless runner as previously noted.

## Hygiene
- `technomancy/deliverables/src` and `technomancy/deliverables/tests` cleared after merge (scripts only).
- Runtime artifacts confined to `school_sim/runtime/**` as expected.
- `/technomancy/deliverables/**` contains no shippable files.
