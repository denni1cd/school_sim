- Overlay confirmed active by **08:02** (event logged).

## Changes Landed
- Added club documentation (Clubs Deep Dive) describing config schema, capacity/cost behavior, and office roster monitoring.
- README now highlights the `Clubs` tab output alongside policy/clubs/curriculum operations so make run behavior is documented.
- Earlier club system additions (`school_sim/clubs.py`, world/headless/office integration) remain in place as described previously.

## Hygiene
- `technomancy/deliverables/src` and `technomancy/deliverables/tests` cleared post-merge (scripts only remain).
- Runtime artifacts confined to `school_sim/runtime/**`.
- No shippable content left under `technomancy/deliverables/**`.
